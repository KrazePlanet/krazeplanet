# Getting Started with Bug Bounty Hunting üêû

Bug bounty hunting is a rewarding way to improve your cybersecurity skills while earning money by finding vulnerabilities in websites, apps, and software. In this guide, we'll cover the basics so you can get started confidently.

## What is a Bug Bounty Program?

A **bug bounty program** is offered by companies that pay ethical hackers (white-hat hackers) for reporting security vulnerabilities in their systems.  

Some popular platforms include:

- [HackerOne](https://www.hackerone.com/)
- [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)
- [Synack](https://www.synack.com/)

## Why Participate in Bug Bounties?

Participating in bug bounties allows you to:

1. **Improve your security skills** by practicing real-world scenarios.
2. **Earn money legally** for finding vulnerabilities.
3. **Gain recognition** in the cybersecurity community.
4. **Help make the internet safer** for everyone.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you start hunting, you need a good setup:

- A computer with Linux or macOS (preferred for pentesting tools)
- **Browser tools** like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP
- **Proxy tools** to analyze web requests
- **Code editors** like VSCode for testing scripts

```bash
# Example: Install Burp Suite Community Edition on Linux
